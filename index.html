        <p>Welcome to "LabRat", a text-based game that puts you in the shoes of an unwilling subject in a crazy experiment. Your goal is to escape the lab, but it won´t be easy. The mad scientists running the experiment have put a series of bizarre and dangerous puzzles and challenges in your way. You'll have to use your wits and your problem-solving skills to solve these and make your way out of the lab. Along the way you will meet other participants trapped in the lab with you. Helping them might help you. But be careful! Not everyone can be trusted. Will you be able to outsmart the challenges and escape? There´s only one way to find out. Are you ready to start?</p>
